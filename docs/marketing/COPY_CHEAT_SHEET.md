- [ ] Does it acknowledge the user's perspective?
- [ ] Could it be shorter?
- [ ] Is it confident (not uncertain)?
- [ ] Does it make the user feel capable?
- [ ] Is there a clear next action?
- [ ] Would I want to receive this message?
```

If you answer NO to any, rewrite before publishing.

## CONVERSION COPYWRITING QUICK WIN

**Rule of 3:**

Every message should:
1. Acknowledge a problem the user has
2. Show how you solve it
3. Prove it works (social proof, specificity, or both)

Example:
```
"Every morning you wonder: should I leave?
Outia combines weather, traffic, and reports.
500K drivers already know: it works."
```
